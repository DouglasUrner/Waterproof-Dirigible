### Programming Tools

[Git](http://git-scm.com) is an open source version control system. It is a very useful tool, but it can also be challenging to learn to use. This interactive tutorial, [Code School - Try Git](http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1), can help you get started. Git will be one of the major tools that we use in this class. We will use [GitHub](https://github.com) to host our source code. One of the advantages of doing this is that you will be able to get to your source code from anywhere you have Internet access.
