# HTML Tutorial

One of your major tasks in this class is to become familiar with the HyperText Markup Language, aka HTML. HTML is the language used to define the **content** (as opposed to the appearance, which is the job of CSS) of web pages. We will focus on learning HTML 5 – it is the most recent version.

## Objective

Your objective in this assignment is to create a "boilerplate" HTML page that you can use as a template for new pages that you code by hand. Having a template makes life a bit simpler by providing you with a consistent starting point for you work. It can also be a place to store your favorite "snippets" of code.

Since you template is likely to evolve over time you should store it on GitHub.

## Getting Started

The basics of HTML are very simple, so it is probably best to jump in and get started. One of the better ways to do this is with an HTML 101 tutorial. There are a number of good ones that you can start with. I recommend these two:

**[The W3 Schools HTML Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)**

**[The HTML Dog Beginner Tutorial](http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner)**

## Getting Your Good Work Noticed (or how to turn your work in)

You've been storing your work on GitHub, right? When you're ready to have me take a look at it, just sent me a link.
