HTML
----

Modern web design makes a distinction between _content_ and _presentation_. The Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is used to create the content of a web site.

Our objective in this section is to learn enough HTML to understand what we see when we look at the code of a web site. We will emphasize learning the _syntax_ of _well_ _formed_ HTML code, the structure of modern web pages, and some of the more commonly used _tags_ – and the methods to discover new tags when you find that you need to do something new or different.

The job of CSS is to manage the _presentation_ of the content. Maintaining the distinction between content and presentation enables making changes to either without (too much) risk of disturbing the other. Content creators and designers can co-exist on the same project without stepping on each others' feet. This also means that content can easily be _retargeted_ to other "displays." For example from a conventional desktop web browser to a screen reader or a printer.

JavaScript
----------

JavaScript is a programming language that was developed to support interactive applications running in a web browsers.

There are way to many fonts in the world! Well, maybe not, but picking a font – in a meaningful way – can be a daunting task. The trick is to develop and eye – and a feel – for type. This comes down to looking closely and noticing how you respond to different typefaces. You'll start to notice that you have opinions about the fonts that you're looking at and ideas about the message that they convey. Now you're on the road to being able to make meaningful choices about fonts. Here are some exercises to get you started. Mostly they will ask you to look closely, to notice differences between fonts. Your job is to notice how you react to the fonts, how you would describe them, and the messages they convey to you. Try these:
