## Goals

My assessment philosophy is built around these goals:

1. To provide meaningful real-time (or as close to real-time as practical) feedback on student growth.
2. To be specific about what is being assessed and how the student is doing that area. Assessments that provide a single overall score rarely do this. It can be a significant problem to know what you are assessing. For example: in math the class might be working on the concept of slope and intercepts. In an effort to assess understanding the teacher might describe a real world scenario where these concepts are used and ask the students to apply their understanding to the problem. This could be a very good assessment – it asks students to evaluate a situation and apply their understanding to it in a relatively authentic fashion. In doing this the assessment, intentionally or not, tests comprehension, critical thinking skills, vocabulary, and problem solving along with the knowledge of the material the class is working on. To be a valid assessment the teacher has to recognize this and find a way to extract the desired information from the results of the assessment and then reflect that information back to the students and use it herself to inform what she will be doing next in the classroom. It is higly likely that some of what is being assessed is not being taught in that class, and that some of these things stand as "gatekeepers" to the skill that the teacher would like to assess. One of the simplest examples would be that of attempting to assess a skill that is taught to non-native speakers in English. This assessment is going to have a signficant compenent of assessing English language comprehension. That component may actually make it impossible to assess what the assessment is suppossedly assessing.
3. To employ (or at least be open to) a variety of means for students to demonstrate their learning.
2. To remove the stress around maintaining grades, with the expectation that this will lead most students to be in a better place to focus on learning.
3. To provide accurate feedback on progress towards mastery, while allowing students to move forward at their own pace, without turning challenges or slow progress into "bad" grades.
4. To be accountable for my part in the learning process – I need to be able to guide students to the challenges and processes that will facilitate their learning. If I am unable to do this for a particular student, this does not represent failure on the part of the student.
5. To encourage and support the development of durable understandings and skills.

## Theories, Beliefs, and Values

* Learning happens when the learner is engaged in a mindful process of attempting to get better at something.
* The role of the teacher is to help guide the student to challenges in the field that will facilitate learning and to help the student analyze failure.
* Failure is essential to learning. Growth comes from trying things that we don't know how to do, frequently we fail before we learn how to do the new thing. Analyzing the failure and trying again are essential to the learning process, without failure – and analysis – there would be no learning.
* The only part of the process that I can control is myself. I have to accept my students as they come to me and help them build on what they bring to the classroom.
* People relish learning.
* Learning can be difficult, frustrating, humbling, but it is also intrinsicly rewarding and motivating.
* Absent organic or psychological damage everyone can and wants to learn.
* Lack of interest in learning (or the apparent lack of interest) is indicitive of a place where the student needs an ally and advocate.
* The content we teach is (or should be) fundamental to developing as a functional and engaged citizen. The process of learning is even more important as it is the basis for learning the content – and a student who is an excellent learning can, and will, make up for the shortcomings of the school, curriculum, teacher, or alloted time.

## Assessment Philosophy

The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability, trying it, analyzing your performance while and after doing it, and correcting any mistakes. Then repeat. And repeat again. There appear to be no real shortcuts. From Peter Norvig "Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years" (http://norvig.com/21-days.html, this link is in English, but there are quite a number of translations at this link as well)

I would like grading in my classes to be more about providing feedback on your progress than about "evaluating" you. So I use a "B Contract" as the core of my grading process. I discovered the idea through articles written by Peter Elbow describing how he grades his writing classes at UMass Amherst. The essential idea is that if a student does a set of things the s/he will be guaranteed a 'B' in the class. For the teacher then, the job is to identify the things that someone needs to do to reliably develop the skills that would warrent a 'B'. The way that I keep track of how it is going is by identifying the skills and knowledge that the class requires and tracking progress towards mastering these skills. If the student consistently does the work towards mastery, I expect that s/he will develop mastery by the end of the semester and her (or his) grade will be a 'B' – however if the student does not engage in this practice then the contract is broken. In that case the grade will be reported as whatever the standards show (which will probably be lower than a 'B').

Many students strive for an 'A' – an 'A' represents being very good at what we're doing. There's a problem here. Students learning new things usually aren't very good at them. They are learning and that means they aren't all that proficient – yet. So an 'A' can't represent being very good at the content. In my classes an 'A' is earned by being very good at the process of getting better, by providing evidence of independent and self-intitated work on appropriate challenges and assessment of the results, by being willing to try out the practices that masters of the craft believe help with acheiving mastery, and by contributing to a positive learning environment. 'A' students are exceptional in their persistence and commitment to learning – for most this also means that they are producing exceptional work.

Students working for a 'B' are expected to come to their one-on-one meetings with evidence of having done regular work on the practices that lead to mastery. Evidence consists of demonstrating understanding of the work, examples of the work, and reflection upon the work. The key is regular deliberate practice. For students who are finding the work easy we'll discuss how to move faster or how to work towards an 'A'. For students who are struggling we will work on finding challenges that are a better fit.

Students working for an 'A' are expected to come to conferences prepared with examples of the challenges they have found for themselves, the results of their work on the challenge, and their assessment (reflection) on how the challenge went. The key difference between an 'A' and a 'B' is the source of the challenge (and the appropriateness of the challenge – the challenge needs to be genuine).

## Grade Reports

Students get two "grade" reports. The first, and most important, is the report of progress on the standards. This report contains the information about the student's areas of strength and weakness and provides guidance on where to concentrate practice.

The second is a letter grade which roughly translates as:
* A: an effective and self-directed learner
* B: consistently working "the method that works" _or_ not working the method, but in some other way meeting the standards
* C: not working the method, and demonstrating a low level of mastery
* NC: not working the method, and providing little or no evidence of mastery

There is no 'D' – this is because the level of understanding and skill that goes with a 'D' on a traditional grading scale does not reflect any substantial mastery of the material. A 'D' is not a foundation for going on to do futher work in the field nor does it does not reflect an understanding of the material that is sufficient in itself. The way I grade the only students who could get a 'D' would be those who both did not enage in the process of learning for the class and who also were unable to show even a low, but workable, understanding of the content of the class. Further, with a goal of developing students who are first and foremost excellent learners a 'D' is a very unlikely outcome. Students who work the process are unlikely to end up with such a low level of mastery. Students who break the contract and also acheive very little are a call for investigation.

Likewise there is no 'F' – it does not make sense to brand a student who was unable to participate in the system as a "failure." The problem reflects, at the very least, the inability of the student to engage in the process and the inability of the teacher to figure out alternative stategies. This is probably componded by the lack of other options in the system (or the lack of awareness of them). It may be reasonable to desribe the overall effort as a "failure" but it is not reasonable to lay the blame solely on the student. Even if the problem can be fairly placed solely on the student (and I don't think it can be) there is still the question of why a human, who is intrisicly driven to learn, was unable to learn in this environment – what happened to him, or her, and how could this have been addressed? When nothing seems to work, the fairest and most compasionate thing seems to be to award no credit ('NC') and investigate other options.

Some students may consistently and faithfully "work the system" and still not be able to bring their skills up to the level that would warrent a 'B' on a traditional grading scale. When this happens, I belive that it represents a failure on my part to design practices that will help this particular student get to that level of proficency. By providing timely and detailed reflection on how they are (or are not) progressing the student has fulfilled her end of the bargain and she (or he) will still be awarded a 'B'. The standards report will provide a picture of where the difficulties are. As Dr. Tae tells us "nobody knows how long it takes anybody to learn anything." Through experience and observation we may think we know, but only when we're talking averages…

### Formative Assessment

The primary mode of formative assessment is, ideally, questions from the student. The teacher may also ask questions and design activities to gather information about how the work is going. Since students will not all be in the same place at the same time it will often not be possible to do classwide formative assessment.

### Summative Assessment

There are two major methods of summative assessment.

The first is the regular bi-weekly (or weekly if possible) one-on-one conferences with each student. In the conference we look at the work the student has done since the last conference and take stock of how the student is engaging in the process. In general there is a "no excuses" policy – instead we look at problems that were encountered (expecting them to be clearly described and analyzed) and the approach that was taken to solving them.

I take notes during the conference for the student (the student is welcome to take notes as well, but the conference is in part oral exam and it seems kinder for me to take the notes and let the student concentrate on the discussion) and the student is expected to summarize the notes after the conference. Typically the summary will be posted to the student's account on the class web site.

The second are the major class projects – typically two or three per semester – these projects are big and complex and messy (all of which are relative) and have a general theme within which the student is expected to work. The projects are designed to provide an opportunity to use (and demonstrate) most or all of the skills and knowledge that we have been developing in the class.

### Breaking the Contract

Any of the following represent a breach of the contract:
* Not attending three or more one-on-one conferences. Conferences are generally scheduled during class time, make up conferences are typically scheduled outside of class time (it can be difficult to fit in the regularly scheduled conferences, so there is often no room for make up conferences during class time). Make up conferences are scheduled for excused absences.
* Being unprepared for three of more one-on-one conferences. Being unprepared means coming to the conference without evidence of the work done since the last conference. This includes thoughtful and specific reflection on the work.
