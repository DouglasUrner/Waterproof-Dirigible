## Goals

My assessment philosophy is built around these goals:
1. To provide meaningful real-time (or as close to real-time as practical) feedback on student growth.
2. To remove the stress around maintaining grades, with the expectation that this will lead most students to be in a better place to focus on learning.
3. To provide accurate feedback on progress towards mastery, while allowing students to move forward at their own pace, without turning challenges or slow progress into "bad" grades.
4. To be accountable for my part in the learning process – I need to be able to guide students to the challenges and processes that will facilitate their learning. If I am unable to do this for a particular student, this does not represent failure on the part of the student.

## Theories, Beliefs, and Values

* Learning happens when the learner is engaged in a mindful process of attempting to get better at something.
* The role of the teacher is to help guide the student to challenges in the field that will facilitate learning and to help the student analyze failure.
* Failure is essential to learning.
* The only part of the process that I can control is myself. I have to accept my students as they come to me and help them build on what they bring to the classroom.
* People relish learning.
* Learning can be difficult, frustrating, humbling, but it is also intrinsicly rewarding and motivating.
* Absent organic or psychological damage everyone can and wants to learn.
* Lack of interest in learning (or the apparent lack of interest) is indicitive of a place where the student needs an ally and advocate.

## Inspirations:
* Montessori classrooms where students work at their own pace and manage their own time.
* Peter Elbow's 'B' Contract
* Dr. Tae's TED Talk on Skateboarding and Education ()
* Malcolm Gladwell, Peter Norvig, and many other contributors to the discussion around "10,000 hours."
* Carol Dweck's work on Mindsets

## Assessment Philosophy

The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability, trying it, analyzing your performance while and after doing it, and correcting any mistakes. Then repeat. And repeat again. There appear to be no real shortcuts. From Peter Norvig "Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years" (http://norvig.com/21-days.html, this link is in English, but there are quite a number of translations at this link as well)

I would like grading in my classes to be more about providing feedback on your progress than about "evaluating" you. So I use a "B Contract" as the core of my grading process. I discovered the idea through articles written by Peter Elbow describing how he grades his writing classes at UMass Amherst. The essential idea is that if a student does a set of things the s/he will be guaranteed a 'B' in the class. For the teacher then, the job is to identify the things that someone needs to do to reliably develop the skills that would warrent a 'B'. The way that I keep track of how it is going is by identifying the skills and knowledge that the class requires and tracking progress towards mastering these skills. If the student consistently does the work towards mastery, I expect that s/he will develop mastery by the end of the semester and her (or his) grade will be a 'B' – however if the student does not engage in this practice then the contract is broken. In that case the grade will be reported as whatever the standards show (which will probably be lower than a 'B').

Many students strive for an 'A' – an 'A' represents being very good at what we're doing. There's a problem here. Students learning new things usually aren't very good at them. They are learning and that means they aren't all that proficient – yet. So an 'A' can't represent being very good at the content. In my classes an 'A' is earned by being very good at the process of getting better, by providing evidence of independent and self-intitated work on appropriate challenges and assessment of the results, by being willing to try out the practices that masters of the craft believe help with acheiving mastery, and by contributing to a positive learning environment. 'A' students are exceptional in their persistence and commitment to learning – for most this also means that they are producing exceptional work.

Students working for a 'B' are expected to come to their one-on-one meetings with evidence of having done regular work on the practices that lead to mastery. Evidence consists of demonstrating understanding of the work, examples of the work, and reflection upon the work. The key is regular deliberate practice. For students who are finding the work easy we'll discuss how to move faster or how to work towards an 'A'. For students who are struggling we will work on finding challenges that are a better fit.

Students working for an 'A' are expected to come to conferences prepared with examples of the challenges they have found for themselves, the results of their work on the challenge, and their assessment (reflection) on how the challenge went. The key difference between an 'A' and a 'B' is the source of the challenge (and the appropriateness of the challenge – the challenge needs to be genuine).

## Grade Reports

Students get two "grade" reports. The first, and most important, is the report of progress on the standards. This report contains the information about the student's areas of strength and weakness and provides guidance on where to concentrate practice.

The second is a letter grade which roughly translates as:
* A: an effective and self-directed learner
* B: consistently working "the method that works" _or_ not working the method, but in some other way meeting the standards
* C: not working the method, and demonstrating a low level of mastery
* NC: not working the method, and providing little or no evidence of mastery

There is no 'D' – this is because the level of understanding and skill that goes with the traditional 'D' does not reflect any substantial mastery of the material. A 'D' is not a foundation for going on to do futher work and it does not reflect an understanding of the material that is sufficient in itself. The way I grade the only students who could get a 'D' would be those who both did not enage in the process of learning for the class and who also were unable to show even a low, but workable, understanding of the content of the class.

Some students may consistently and faithfully "work the system" and still not be able to bring their skills up to the level that would warrent a 'B'. When this happens, I belive that it represents a failure on my part to design practices that will help this particular student get to that level of proficency. By providing timely and detailed reflection on how they are (or are not) progressing the student has fulfilled her end of the bargain and she (or he) will still be awarded a 'B'. The standards report will provide a picture of where the difficulties are. As Dr. Tae tells us "nobody knows how long it takes anybody to learn anything." Through experience and observation we may think we know, but only when we're talking averages…

### Formative Assessment

The primary mode of formative assessment is

### Summative Assessment

There are two major methods of summative assessment.

The first is the regular bi-weekly (or weekly if possible) one-on-one conferences with each student. In the conference we look at the work the student has done since the last conference and take stock of how the student is engaging in the process. In general there is a "no excuses" policy – instead we look at problems that were encountered (expecting them to be clearly described and analyzed) and the approach that was taken to solving them.

I take notes during the conference for the student (the student is welcome to take notes as well, but the conference is in part oral exam and it seems kinder for me to take the notes and let the student concentrate on the discussion) and the student is expected to summarize the notes after the conference. Typically the summary will be posted to the student's account on the class web site.

The second are the major class projects – typically two or three per semester – these projects are big and complex and messy (all of which are relative) and have a general theme within which the student is expected to work. The projects are designed to provide an opportunity to use (and demonstrate) most or all of the skills and knowledge that we have been developing in the class.

### Breaking the Contract

Any of the following represent a breach of the contract:
* Not attending three or more one-on-one conferences. Conferences are generally scheduled during class time, make up conferences are typically scheduled outside of class time (it can be difficult to fit in the regularly scheduled conferences, so there is often no room for make up conferences during class time). Make up conferences are scheduled for excused absences.
* Being unprepared for three of more one-on-one conferences. Being unprepared means coming to the conference without evidence of the work done since the last conference. This includes thoughtful and specific reflection on the work.
