HTML
----

Modern web design makes a distinction between _content_ and _presentation_. The Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is used to create the content of a web site.

Our objective in this section is to learn enough HTML to understand what we see when we look at the code of a web site. We will emphasize learning the _syntax_ of _well_ _formed_ HTML code, the structure of modern web pages, and some of the more commonly used _tags_ – and the methods to discover new tags when you find that you need to do something new or different.

CSS
---

The job of CSS is to manage the _presentation_ of the content. Maintaining the distinction between content and presentation enables making changes to either without (too much) risk of disturbing the other. Content creators and designers can co-exist on the same project without stepping on each others' feet. This also means that content can easily be _retargeted_ to other "displays." For example from a conventional desktop web browser to a screen reader or a printer.

JavaScript
----------

JavaScript is a programming language that was developed to support interactive applications running in a web browsers.
